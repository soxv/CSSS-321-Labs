## Goals for Week 5

- QSS Tutorial 4
- Key Question in Week 5
  - What is selection bias in survey sampling? How can we solve this problem?
  - How can we describe the relationship between two variables?
- Deciphering Problem Set 2

# Survey Sampling

---

![Source: Groves et al. 2009](./img/survey_lifecycle.png)

---

- Measurement
  - Construct validity: the extent to which the measure is related to the underlying construct/concept
  - Measurement error: 
    - e.g. underreporting of sensitive behaviors
  - Processing error: i.e. data entry error
- Representation: we want our estimate of certain variable to be as representative (i.e. externally valid) as possible.
  - Coverage error: the nonobservational gap between the target population and the sampling frame
    - e.g. sampling through phone calls can make the resulting sample less representative.
  - Sampling error: non observational gap between the sampling frame and the sample
    - e.g. some members of the sampling frame are given smaller chance of selection
  - Non-response error
    - Unit non-response
    - Item non-response
  - Adjustment error

# Correlation

---

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Corr}(x, y) =& \frac{\text{Cov}(x, y)}{\sigma_x \sigma_y} \\
=& \frac{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n [(x_i - \bar{x}) (y_i - \bar{y})]}{\sigma_x \sigma_y} \\
=& \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n [\text{z-score}(x) \times \text{z-score}(y)]
\end{aligned}
$$

- Covariance: To what extent the two variables covary *on average*.
- Correlation: covariance of the two variables rescaled by their standard deviations.

# Deciphering Problem Set 2

## Overview

- Research Question: Does having daughters cause judges to vote in a pro-feminist direction?
  - Study type: observational studies
  - Explanatory variable: whether a judge has at least one daughter.
  - Outcome variable: `progressive.vote` - The **proportion** of the judge’s votes on women’s issues which were decided in a pro-feminist direction.
- Potential Confounders
  - a judge's gender (Q2)
  - a judge's party identification (Q2 & Q3)
  - whether a judge has at least one child (Q3)
  - the number of children (Q4)
  - other confounders? Can we assess them in the existing data? (Q5)
- The goal of each question
  - Q1: summary statistics and check balance
  - Q2: association between `progressive.vote` and two confounders - `republican` and `woman`
  - Q3: association between `progressive.vote` and two confounders - whether a judge has at least one child and `republican`
  - Q4: association between `progressive.vote` and explanatory variable - whether a judge has at least one daughter, conditional on the total number of children
    - Considering confounding bias and covariate balance, should we include judges who have no child?
  - Q5: assess the plausibility of unconfoundedness assumption
    - Is the number of children correlated with both children's gender and `progressive.vote`?
    - Is any other pre-treatment variables potentially correlated with both children's gender and `progressive.vote`?

## Question 1

- The total number of judges; gender composition and party composition
- Party composition between male and female judges (Hint: create a contingency table showing proportion)
- Range of the outcome variable `progressive.vote`.
- Interpret the result.

## Question 2

- Create a boxplot with **one single command** to compare the distribution of `progressive.vote` across 4 groups: Republican men, Republican women, Democratic men, Democratic women. (Hint: `y ~ x1 + x2` in `boxplot()`)
- Interpret the result.

## Question 3

- Create a binary variable that denotes if a judge has at least one child.
- Compare the distribution of this binary variable between Republican and Democratic judges. (Hint: difference in means)
- Compute the difference in means of `progressive.vote` between judges who have at least one child and those who don't.
- Compute the difference in means of `progressive.vote` between Republican and Democratic parents.
  - Hint: compute difference in means for each group, or use `tapply(..., list(..., ...), mean)`
  - e.g. Republican parents: judges who are republican and who have at least one child

## Question 4

- Compute difference in means of `progressive.vote` between judges who have at least one daughter and those who don't have any.
- Repeat the same computation across judges with different number of children.
    - only focus on judges with 1, 2, and 3 children. 
    - Hint: compute difference in means for each group, or use `tapply(..., list(..., ...), mean)`
- What assumption do we need to interpret previous results?

## Question 5

Conditional on the number of children, the number of daughters a judge has is random. How can we evaluate the validity of this assumption?

- Compare the means of `girls` across judges with different number of children.
- Compare the means of `girls` across judges, divided by other potential confounders in the data.
